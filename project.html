      <p class = "team-text">Since the inception of our project in 2018, our team has been working to design and implement a solar powered irrigation system in Sunuka, Tanzania. Sunuka is currently unable to increase their agricultural output due to the limitations of the dry season. However our team's design will allow for increased water access and consequently increase crop yield. Since February 2018, we have travelled on two assessment trips to establish our relationship with the Sunuka community and retrieve the necessary irrigation data. Keeping in mind social, structural and economic feasibility our team evaluated potential water sources and irrigation distribution techniques, and has been working to finalize system plans. With implementation tentatively scheduled for summer 2022, our designs are currently being submitted for community approval and for additional analysis by irrigation experts. In the meantime, our team is working to maintain community relations and develop a universal irrigation system toolbox.</p>
