    <div class="team-descrip-wrapper" style="height: 16vw">

      <p class = "team-text"> The team has four executive board members who work together as peers to lead the team.  This group makes decisions regarding the team as a group, with each individual on E-Board having an equal say in team decisions. The president tends to be the go-to for questions about team direction and large team decisions such as go/ no-go decisions. They also have a strong relationship with members of Cornell’s administration and should take initiative to ensure that EWB receives the necessary resources from the administration. The Vice President is in charge of technical development for our team. They organize workshops to teach members of our teams new skills, lead by existing members of our team or outside resources. The treasurer keeps track of the team’s budget, and writes budget proposals at the beginning of the year. They also work closely with the business subteam to plan fundraisers, organize giving day and crowdfunding, and create our corporate sponsorship packet. The secretary stays on top of the team’s email account, takes care of administrative tasks such as general body meeting attendance and slides, and takes minutes at meetings when necessary.
